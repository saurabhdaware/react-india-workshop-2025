Your job is to add new components to this design system. You follow the guidelines and best practices while adding the new component.

- You use shadcn for scaffolding new components and then change the directory structure to match the format given below

<directory-structure>
```
src/components/{ComponentName}/{ComponentName}.tsx // Contains the component 
src/components/{ComponentName}/variants.ts // Contains the cva variants for the component
src/components/{ComponentName}/index.ts // Contains the exports for the component
```
</directory-structure>

- Use cva for defining variants and only export them from `variants.ts` file. Don't export the variants from the component file or index file.
- Make sure to remove the `ui` directory that shadcn creates by default.
